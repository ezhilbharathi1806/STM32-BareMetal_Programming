The STM32F407 Discovery Board is based on the STM32F407 microcontroller, which is part of the STM32F4 series from STMicroelectronics. This microcontroller includes advanced timers that are crucial for a wide variety of applications, including time measurement, PWM generation, motor control, and signal processing.

In STM32F407, the timers are highly flexible, offering several different modes to interact with the system, including generating periodic interrupts, controlling PWM signals, and measuring input signals.

### Types of Timers in STM32F407

The STM32F407 microcontroller has several types of timers with different capabilities:

1. **Basic Timers**:
   - **TIM6** and **TIM7** are basic timers that can be used for time base generation and simple delays. They don’t have features like PWM or input capture but are used for periodic interrupts and event generation.
   
2. **General-Purpose Timers**:
   - **TIM2**, **TIM3**, **TIM4**, and **TIM5** are general-purpose timers that offer more functionality, including input capture, output compare, PWM generation, and event triggers. These timers are often used for tasks like periodic interrupts, signal generation, and external signal measurements.

3. **Advanced-Control Timers**:
   - **TIM1** and **TIM8** are advanced-control timers. These timers include features like dead-time insertion, complementary outputs, and other advanced functions for applications like motor control and power electronics.

4. **Low-Power Timers**:
   - **LPTIM** is a low-power timer found in STM32L series, but it’s not present in STM32F407. However, the general-purpose timers on the F407 can be used in low-power modes with reduced frequencies.

### Timer Functionalities in STM32F407

Timers in STM32F407 can perform various tasks depending on their configuration. Some of the key functionalities include:

#### 1. **Time Base Generation**
   - Timers can be used as a time base generator for periodic tasks. They can be configured to generate interrupts at regular time intervals. This feature is useful for creating time delays or executing tasks in a periodic manner.
   
#### 2. **PWM Generation**
   - Timers can generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, which are essential for controlling the brightness of LEDs, motor speed, or driving other peripherals. The STM32F407 supports 16-bit PWM channels with configurable frequencies and duty cycles.
   
#### 3. **Input Capture**
   - Timers can capture the time when an external signal changes state. This is useful for measuring pulse width, period, or frequency of an incoming signal. For example, measuring the period of a signal from an external sensor.

#### 4. **Output Compare**
   - Timers can compare the current timer count value with a predefined value in the output compare register. When the values match, the timer triggers an event, such as toggling an output pin, generating an interrupt, or starting another action.

#### 5. **Encoder Interface**
   - Some timers, like **TIM2**, have an encoder interface that allows them to measure the rotation of motors or other rotary encoders. The timers can count pulses from an encoder and report the position and speed.

#### 6. **Event Generation**
   - Timers can be used to trigger events in other peripherals like ADCs or DACs, triggering them at regular time intervals.

#### 7. **Motor Control**
   - Advanced-control timers like **TIM1** and **TIM8** support advanced motor control features, such as dead-time insertion and complementary outputs, making them ideal for controlling motors in applications like robotics or industrial control.

### Performing Timer Calculations

In STM32F407, timers work by counting clock cycles from a specified clock source (usually the system clock or an external clock). To configure the timers to meet specific timing needs, you need to calculate the prescaler and auto-reload register values.

#### Timer Frequency Formula

The timer’s frequency can be calculated using the following formula:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9edb74dc-f828-4193-84af-0d23f7a734a6)

Where:
- **f_clk** is the clock frequency provided to the timer (typically the system clock or a separate timer clock).
- **prescaler** is a value that divides the clock frequency to slow down the timer.
- **auto-reload** is the value that sets the overflow point of the timer. When the timer reaches this value, it resets and starts counting from zero again.

#### Example 1: Generating a PWM Signal

Suppose you want to generate a PWM signal with a frequency of 1 kHz and a 50% duty cycle. The system clock is 72 MHz, which is common for STM32F407.

1. **Desired PWM Frequency**: 1 kHz
2. **System Clock (f_clk)**: 72 MHz

Using the formula for the timer frequency:

To achieve a 1 kHz PWM signal, we first calculate the timer’s prescaler and auto-reload values.

**Step 1: Choosing Prescaler**

We can choose a prescaler value of 71 to reduce the frequency from 72 MHz to 1 MHz (72 MHz ÷ 72 = 1 MHz). This means the timer will count up to 1 million per second.

**Step 2: Calculating Auto-reload Value**

Now, to get a PWM frequency of 1 kHz, the timer needs to overflow every 1000 ticks (1 ms). Therefore, the auto-reload value should be:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cbf54f1-8724-4e13-9338-e0992c66b883)


So, the timer will overflow every 1000 timer ticks, resulting in a 1 kHz PWM signal.

**Step 3: Configuring the Duty Cycle**

For a 50% duty cycle, the compare value will be half of the auto-reload value:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39276265-e8c6-4fe6-b470-fa7c048a3bc0)


This means the PWM will be high for 499 timer ticks and low for the remaining 500 ticks.

#### Example 2: Creating a 100ms Delay

Now, let’s configure a timer to create a delay of 100 ms, assuming the system clock is 72 MHz.

1. **Desired Time Delay**: 100 ms
2. **System Clock (f_clk)**: 72 MHz

First, calculate the number of timer ticks needed for a 100 ms delay:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ae66d8e-bb48-448c-9903-3a58636083ea)


Next, choose a prescaler to slow down the clock. If we choose a prescaler of 71 (which divides the system clock by 72), we can calculate the auto-reload value.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c7d463e-abe9-4f0e-a349-b07e16c9c776)

So, with a prescaler of 71 and an auto-reload value of 100,000, the timer will overflow after 100 ms, generating a delay.

### Summary

Timers in the STM32F407 microcontroller are versatile and can be used for various tasks like time base generation, PWM generation, input capture, output compare, and event handling. To perform calculations related to timers, you typically use the timer frequency formula:

This allows you to set the prescaler and auto-reload values to achieve the desired timer frequency or time delay. You can use these capabilities to implement time-critical functions like PWM generation, motor control, signal measurement, and event generation in embedded systems.
